# React-News-API

- For this project I am building an application using the following API:
1. [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started)

#### Deliverables
1. Create login functionality in which when you land on the app, you see a login component, and then it switches, to your main container component after you are logged in.  
2.  Inside of your main component you will render at least three properties from your API.
3.  Style your app with semantic-ui-react.

#### To install semantic-ui-react
1.  `npm install semantic-ui-css`
2.  `npm install semantic-ui-react`
3.  Inside of `index.js` above `index.css`, `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`


Bonus: 
 1.	Create an animation when you switch between components
 2.	Complete a logout functionality that switches back the login component
