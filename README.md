- For you homework you are going to build an application of your choice. 
- You may use the following API's,
1. [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started)
2. [Pokemon Api](https://pokeapi.co/)
3. [weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

#### Deliverables
1. Create login functionality in which when you land on the app, you see a login component, and then it switches, to your main container component after you are logged in.  
2.  Inside of your main component you will render at least three properties from your API.
3.  Style your app with semantic-ui-react.

#### To install semantic-ui-react
1.  `npm install semantic-ui-css`
2.  `npm install semantic-ui-react`
3.  Inside of `index.js`above, your `index.css`, `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`

Then you should be good to go!

Bonus: 
 1. Try To create an animation when you switch between components
 2.  Try to complete a logout functionality that switches back the login component
